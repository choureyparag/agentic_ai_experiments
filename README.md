# agentic_ai_experiments

This repository contains experimental code for building agent-based AI
solutions. The `fault_management` package introduces a set of placeholder
agents organised using `LangGraph`. It includes an orchestrator, supervisor
agents and several worker agents for alarm monitoring and suppression.

All modules are scaffolds only; data integration and detailed logic will be
implemented later.
